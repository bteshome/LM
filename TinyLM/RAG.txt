A presidential election was held in the United States on November 5, 2024. The Republican Party's ticket—Donald Trump, who was the 45th president of the United States from 2017 to 2021, and JD Vance, then-junior U.S. senator from Ohio—defeated the Democratic Party's ticket—Kamala Harris, the incumbent U.S. vice president, and Tim Walz, the 41st governor of Minnesota.

The incumbent president, Joe Biden of the Democratic Party, initially ran for re-election and became the party's presumptive nominee. However, after a poor debate performance in June intensified concerns about his age and health, Biden ended his re-election campaign on July 21 and endorsed Harris as his successor. Harris was voted the party's nominee by Democratic delegates on August 5. Harris selected Walz as her running mate. The Harris-Walz ticket supported national abortion protections; LGBT rights; housing subsidies; strengthening the Affordable Care Act (ACA); banning price gouging; increasing the number of Border Patrol agents; and continued military aid to Ukraine and Israel in their respective wars.

Trump, who lost the 2020 presidential election to Biden, ran for re-election again. He was shot in the ear in an assassination attempt on July 13, 2024. Trump was nominated as the Republican Party's presidential candidate during the 2024 Republican National Convention alongside his running mate, Vance. The Trump-Vance ticket supported mass deportation of illegal immigrants;[a] an isolationist "America First" foreign policy agenda with skepticism of Ukraine and support of Israel; anti-transgender policies; and tariffs.

Trump won the Electoral College with 312 electoral votes, while Harris received 226. Trump won every swing state, including the first win of Nevada by Republicans since 2004. Trump won the national popular vote with a plurality of 49.8%, making him the first Republican to win the popular vote since George W. Bush in 2004. Trump became the first president since Grover Cleveland in 1892 to be elected to a non-consecutive second term and the first Republican to do so. Analysts attributed the outcome to the 2021–2023 inflation surge, a global anti-incumbent wave, the unpopularity of the Biden administration, Trump's gains with the working class, and the Mexico–United States border crisis.

In 2020, incumbent Republican President Donald Trump sought re-election, but was defeated by Democratic challenger Joe Biden. Democratic U.S. Senator Kamala Harris of California was elected vice president in 2020 as Biden's running mate.[5]

Trump is the first president in American history to be impeached twice, and the first to run for president again after impeachment. As Trump was acquitted by the Senate in both cases, he was not barred from seeking reelection to the presidency in 2024.[6]

Several state courts and officials, including the Colorado Supreme Court,[7] a state Circuit Court in Illinois,[8] and the Secretary of State of Maine,[9] ruled that Trump was ineligible to hold office under Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution for his role in the January 6 Capitol attack, and thus attempted to disqualify him from appearing on the ballot.[10][9] These attempts were unsuccessful. On March 4, 2024, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously ruled in Trump v. Anderson that states cannot determine eligibility for a national election under Section 3. The Court held that only Congress has the authority to disqualify candidates, or to pass legislation that allows courts to do so.[11]

Donald Trump's false claims of interference

To sow election doubt, Trump escalated use of "rigged election" and "election interference" statements in advance of the 2024 election compared to the previous two elections.[12]
Trump made false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election and denied the validity of the election results.[13][14] In July 2024, The New York Times reported that "the Republican Party and its conservative allies are engaged in an unprecedented legal campaign targeting the American voting system", by restricting voting for partisan advantage ahead of Election Day and preparing to mount "legally dubious" challenges against the certification process if Trump were to lose.[15]

In the lead-up to the 2024 election, the Republican Party made false claims of massive "noncitizen voting" by immigrants in an attempt to delegitimize the election in the event of a Trump defeat.[16][17][18] The claims were made as part of larger Republican Party efforts to disrupt the 2024 election and election denial movement.[19] Trump and several other Republicans stated that they would not accept the results of the 2024 election if they believe they are "unfair".[20]

Trump's previous comments suggesting he could "terminate" the Constitution to reverse his election loss,[21][22] his claim that he would only be a dictator on "day one" of his presidency and not afterwards,[23] his promise to use the Justice Department to go after his political enemies,[24] his plan to use the Insurrection Act of 1807 to deploy the military for law enforcement in primarily Democratic cities and states,[25][26] attempts to overturn the 2020 United States presidential election, his baseless predictions of voter fraud in the 2024 election,[27] and his public embrace and celebration of the January 6 United States Capitol attack,[28] raised concerns over the state of democracy in the United States.[29][30][31][32] Trump's political operation said that it planned to deploy more than 100,000 attorneys and volunteers to polling places across battleground states, with an "election integrity hotline" for poll watchers and voters to report alleged voting irregularities.[33]

The 2024–25 Premier League is the 33rd season of the Premier League and the 126th season of top-flight English football overall. Manchester City entered the season as four-time defending champions, but failed to defend their title. Liverpool emerged as Premier League champions for the second time with four games to spare, equalling Manchester United's record of 20 English league titles.

The fixtures were released on 18 June 2024, consisting of 33 weekend rounds, four midweek rounds, and one Bank Holiday matchweek. The two-week winter break, in effect since the 2019–20 season, was scrapped starting this season in favour of a longer summer break for the players. Longer intervals between matches were added for the holiday period between Christmas and New Year's Day, with no matches held on Christmas Eve.[1][2][3]

The summer transfer window opened on 14 June 2024 and closed at 23:00 BST on 30 August 2024. The winter window opened on 1 January 2025 and closed at 23:00 GMT on 3 February 2025.[4] This is also the last season the Nike sponsor match ball for the top flight is used, Puma are set to become the official ball supplier of the top flight starting from the 2025–26 season.[5]

This season is the first to use semi-automated offside technology, as Premier League clubs unanimously agreed to its introduction. The technology was planned to be introduced after one of the autumn international breaks,[6] but was delayed to further test the technology. It was tested in the FA Cup fifth round onwards,[7] after which the Premier League confirmed that the technology would be used in matchweek 32, on 12 April 2025. The Etihad Stadium was the first to officially use the technology, during Manchester City's match against Crystal Palace.[8][9]

On 6 April 2025, Southampton became the first team to be relegated to the EFL Championship, after just one year in the top flight, following a 3–1 defeat away to Tottenham Hotspur. With only 10 points from 31 games, they became the first team in Premier League history to go down with seven matches left to play, breaking the record shared by Derby County in 2007–08, Huddersfield Town in 2018–19 and Sheffield United in 2020–21, who were all relegated with six matches remaining (matchweek 32).[22] The next day, the club announced that Ivan Jurić had left his role as manager after just 108 days in charge, having won only two games during his spell (one in the Premier League and one in the FA Cup).

On the same day, Leicester City became the second team to be relegated after a 1–0 defeat at home to Liverpool, extending their record of consecutive goalless home matches, becoming the first club in top flight history to fail to score in nine consecutive home matches.

On 26 April 2025, Ipswich Town became the third and final team to be relegated after a 3–0 loss to Newcastle United, meaning that for the second season in a row, all three promoted teams went straight back down. It was only the third time in English top flight history in which this has happened, the first being in 1997–98. This also marked the first time in the Premier League era that all three relegated teams had been confirmed with more than four games to play, breaking the record of more than two games to play set in the 2020–21 season.

On 27 April 2025, Liverpool beat Tottenham Hotspur 5–1 at Anfield to secure their second Premier League title with four games remaining, tying the record for total English league titles of 20 with rivals Manchester United.

The promoted teams are Leicester City, Ipswich Town and Southampton. Leicester City and Southampton returned after one-year absences, while Ipswich Town returned after a twenty-two-year absence. They replaced Luton Town, Burnley and Sheffield United, who were all relegated after just one season in the top flight, the first time since the 1997–98 season that all three promoted teams were relegated after just one season.[29]

The 2025 Copa del Rey final was a football match to decide the winners of the 2024–25 Copa del Rey, the 123rd edition of Spain's primary football cup (including two seasons where two rival editions were played). The match was played on 26 April 2025 at Estadio de La Cartuja in Seville – in the first event at the venue following its expansion and conversion from an athletics facility ahead of its use at the 2030 FIFA World Cup[4] – between arch rivals Barcelona and Real Madrid.[5] It was the 260th competitive match between the sides and the first in a Copa del Rey final since 2014. Barcelona won the match 3–2 after extra time for a record-extending 32nd Copa del Rey title.
